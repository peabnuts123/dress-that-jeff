# Dress That Jeff!

It's an incredibly important application the lets you DRESS THAT JEFF!

## Developing locally

In order to run the project locally, you will need Node.js installed. Any recent version is fine.

To develop the application locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the application `npm start`
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## TODO

The application is moderately functional but contains absolutely no UI or UX.

Outstanding work is: 
  - Make it look nice / match the design
    - Add title / header - DONE 
    - Positioning / sizing of the 2 main components: "Jeff" and the Controls 
    - Hovering and clicking styles on interactable elements (e.g. item buttons, accordion headings)
    - BONUS: Highlight which item is selected ðŸ¤”
  - Expand / collapse each section (accordion component)
    - Expanding one section collapses the others
  - Ability to select "None" in each section
  - Make the Hue slide change the hue of the previews tiles also
  - Deploy application to S3 or something

Lizzy notes:

Hue controls: 
â€¢	Lizzy to fix - input inside label? span for label words
-Fix with flex

Finding font sizing confusing
â€¢	What to set at so it scales appropriately?
â€¢	Currently causing things to break and go on other lines
